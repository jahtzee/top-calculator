# top-calculator

This is a JavaScript project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator).

The catch here is evaluating the arithmetic expression that the user supplies. When pressing the '=' button, the expression is converted from standard infix to postfix notation, which can then be evaluated by using a stack.
